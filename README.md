# Mood-Prediction
<p>This is a CNN model which predicts your mood from your Facial Expression. It works both on Live Detection and on Static Images<p>

<h3>Dataset</h3>
<p>The Dataset is available on Kaggle under the name FER2013 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data">Dataset</a>.

<h3>For Live Detection</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Run The CNN Code First</li>
    <li>In the Folder run the code of "main.py" and it will run on your port:5000 and you can go to your browser window and type "localhost:5000". It will use your Web Camera and predict your mood </li>
</ul>

<h3>Libraries Used</h3>
<p>Note: You will need to have these librairies to run the Python Code</p>
<ul>
    <li>Numpy For Matrix Calculations</li>
    <li>Matplotlib For Plotting Up Graphs</li>
    <li>Keras and Tensorflow For Creating the CNN Model</li>
    <li>CV2 For Live Detection</li>
    <li>Flask For Hosting it on the Web</li>
</ul>
